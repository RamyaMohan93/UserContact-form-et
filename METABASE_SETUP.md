# Metabase Setup for CortexCatalyst Analytics

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### 1. Start Metabase with Docker
\`\`\`bash
# Start the containers
docker-compose up -d

# Check if containers are running
docker-compose ps

# View logs if needed
docker-compose logs metabase
\`\`\`

### 2. Access Metabase
- Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:3001`
- Wait for Metabase to initialize (first startup takes 2-3 minutes)

### 3. Initial Setup
1. **Create Admin Account** (if not using environment variables):
   - Email: admin@cortexcatalyst.com
   - Password: Choose a secure password
   - First Name: Admin
   - Last Name: User

2. **Skip** the "What should we call you?" step or fill as needed

3. **Add Your Supabase Database**:
   - Database type: **PostgreSQL**
   - Host: Your Supabase database host (from SUPABASE_URL)
   - Port: **5432**
   - Database name: **postgres**
   - Username: **postgres** (or your Supabase username)
   - Password: Your Supabase password
   - Additional JDBC connection string options: `?sslmode=require`

### 4. Supabase Connection Details
You'll need these from your Supabase project:

\`\`\`
Host: db.[your-project-ref].supabase.co
Port: 5432
Database: postgres
Username: postgres
Password: [your-database-password]
\`\`\`

To find these in Supabase:
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Click "Settings" â†’ "Database"
3. Find "Connection string" section
4. Use the "URI" format and extract the details

## ðŸ“Š Creating the Challenges Pie Chart

### 1. Create a New Question
1. Click "New" â†’ "Question"
2. Choose "Simple question"
3. Select your database â†’ "public" â†’ "signups" table

### 2. Summarize the Data
1. Click "Summarize"
2. Choose "Count of rows"
3. Group by: Create a custom expression

### 3. Custom Expression for Challenges
Create a custom expression to count challenges:

\`\`\`sql
CASE 
  WHEN [challenge_information_overload] = true THEN "Information Overload"
  WHEN [challenge_difficulty_finding_content] = true THEN "Difficulty Finding Content"
  WHEN [challenge_personalized_learning] = true THEN "Personalized Learning"
  WHEN [challenge_slow_knowledge_absorption] = true THEN "Slow Knowledge Absorption"
  WHEN [challenge_inconsistent_skill_development] = true THEN "Inconsistent Skill Development"
  WHEN [challenge_lack_realtime_feedback] = true THEN "Lack of Real-Time Feedback"
  WHEN [challenge_gaps_existing_knowledge] = true THEN "Gaps in Knowledge"
  WHEN [challenge_limited_time_learning] = true THEN "Limited Time"
  WHEN [challenge_overwhelmed_complex_topics] = true THEN "Complex Topics"
  WHEN [challenge_fragmented_resources] = true THEN "Fragmented Resources"
  WHEN [challenge_other] = true THEN "Other"
  ELSE null
END
\`\`\`

### 4. Alternative: Use Native SQL Query
For more control, use a native SQL query:

\`\`\`sql
WITH challenge_counts AS (
  SELECT 
    'Information Overload' as challenge,
    SUM(CASE WHEN challenge_information_overload THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as count
  FROM signups
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 
    'Difficulty Finding Content' as challenge,
    SUM(CASE WHEN challenge_difficulty_finding_content THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as count
  FROM signups
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 
    'Personalized Learning' as challenge,
    SUM(CASE WHEN challenge_personalized_learning THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as count
  FROM signups
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 
    'Slow Knowledge Absorption' as challenge,
    SUM(CASE WHEN challenge_slow_knowledge_absorption THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as count
  FROM signups
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 
    'Inconsistent Skill Development' as challenge,
    SUM(CASE WHEN challenge_inconsistent_skill_development THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as count
  FROM signups
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 
    'Lack of Real-Time Feedback' as challenge,
    SUM(CASE WHEN challenge_lack_realtime_feedback THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as count
  FROM signups
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 
    'Gaps in Knowledge' as challenge,
    SUM(CASE WHEN challenge_gaps_existing_knowledge THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as count
  FROM signups
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 
    'Limited Time' as challenge,
    SUM(CASE WHEN challenge_limited_time_learning THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as count
  FROM signups
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 
    'Complex Topics' as challenge,
    SUM(CASE WHEN challenge_overwhelmed_complex_topics THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as count
  FROM signups
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 
    'Fragmented Resources' as challenge,
    SUM(CASE WHEN challenge_fragmented_resources THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as count
  FROM signups
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 
    'Other' as challenge,
    SUM(CASE WHEN challenge_other THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as count
  FROM signups
)
SELECT challenge, count
FROM challenge_counts
WHERE count > 0
ORDER BY count DESC;
\`\`\`

### 5. Create Pie Chart
1. After running the query, click "Visualization"
2. Select "Pie Chart"
3. Configure:
   - **Dimension**: challenge
   - **Measure**: count
4. Customize colors and labels as needed

### 6. Save and Add to Dashboard
1. Click "Save" and give it a name: "Learning Challenges Distribution"
2. Create a new dashboard: "CortexCatalyst Analytics"
3. Add the chart to the dashboard

## ðŸŽ¨ Dashboard Enhancements

### Additional Charts to Create:
1. **Signups Over Time** (Line chart)
2. **Geographic Distribution** (if you have country data)
3. **Stay in Loop vs Not** (Donut chart)
4. **Top Subjects** (Bar chart)

### Dashboard Layout:
- Main pie chart (large, top center)
- Summary metrics (small cards at top)
- Supporting charts below

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues:
- Ensure your Supabase database allows external connections
- Check if you need to whitelist Metabase's IP
- Verify SSL requirements (`sslmode=require`)

### Performance:
- For large datasets, consider creating database views
- Use Metabase's caching features
- Schedule regular data refreshes

## ðŸš€ Going Live

### For Production:
1. Use environment variables for sensitive data
2. Set up proper backup for Metabase data
3. Configure reverse proxy (nginx) if needed
4. Set up SSL certificates
5. Consider using managed Postgres for Metabase storage

### Security:
- Change default passwords
- Set up user roles and permissions
- Enable audit logging
- Regular security updates
